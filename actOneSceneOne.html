            Chills. Major chills.

            Feeling like Aaron Swartz.

            His website is so clean. No clutter. Thoughts.
            He truly used the web as the medium it was envisoned as. A place to express yourself to the world. No ruse.

            But, alas! We are all here to make money. Cash, baby!

            Be good.
