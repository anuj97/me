            Here it goes....

            So far I haven't made much of a mark on the face of earth, or the web one can say, as our lives are getting more and more defined by how we present ourselves virtually.

            And this dumb head of mine hasn't been much of help.

            I do like to write about things. Not very great at it, but I believe I can, and want to write a novel someday.

            I like stories. A bit too much maybe. A good story can really spring me into action. This might be true for a lot of people, as stories have helped humans survive and flourish and acquire the top of the food chain.

            A few more words: Second Chances, Follow Ups

            I want to do good. Someday I will.
